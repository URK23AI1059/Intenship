# Water Quality Prediction - RMS

**This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor.**

It was developed as part of a **one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.**

## 🌍 Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets  
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression  
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`  
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive experimentation

## 💧 Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- **NH4**
- **BOD5 (BSK5)**
- **Colloids**
- **O2**
- **NO3**
- **NO2**
- **SO4**
- **PO4**
- **CL**

## 📈 Model Performance

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

✅ **Performance was acceptable across all parameters.**
